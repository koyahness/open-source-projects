# Full EVM dApp: Build and deploy

Building and deploying a full EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) application (DApp) from the Command Line Interface (CLI) is a multi-step process.

We will use the popular Hardhat framework for the contract side and a standard React setup for the frontend, demonstrating a typical integrated project structure.


1. ⚙️ Initial Setup and Project Structure


1.1 Global Prerequisites


Make sure you have Node.js (with npm) and Git installed.


| CLI Command | Description |
|---|---|
| node -v | Check Node.js version |
| npm -v | Check npm version |


1.2 Create the Monorepo Structure


We will create a parent directory to hold both the backend (contracts) and the frontend.


| Path | Description |
|---|---|
| my-evm-dapp/ | Root Project Directory |
| my-evm-dapp/backend/ | Hardhat project for contracts/deployment |
| my-evm-dapp/frontend/ | React/Next.js project for the UI |


# 1. Create the root directory

```
mkdir my-evm-dapp

cd my-evm-dapp

```

# 2. Setup the backend (Hardhat)

```
mkdir backend

cd backend

npm init -y

npm install --save-dev hardhat

npx hardhat init # Select "Create a basic sample project"

cd .. # Go back to my-evm-dapp

```

# 3. Setup the frontend (React example)

```
npx create-react-app frontend

cd frontend

npm install ethers # Library to interact with the blockchain

cd .. # Go back to my-evm-dapp
```

2. 📝 Backend (Smart Contract) CLI Steps
   
We focus on the my-evm-dapp/backend/ directory, which now contains the default Hardhat structure:

```
my-evm-dapp/backend/
├── contracts/        # Your Solidity files live here
│   └── Lock.sol      # (Example contract from Hardhat init)
├── scripts/          # Deployment scripts (Node.js)
│   └── deploy.js
├── test/             # Test files (JavaScript/TypeScript)
├── hardhat.config.js # Configuration file
└── package.json

```

2.1 Write and Compile the Contract

You write your Solidity logic inside the contracts/ directory (e.g., MyContract.sol).


| CLI Command | Directory | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| npx hardhat compile | backend/ | Compiles .sol files into Bytecode and ABI (stored in artifacts/) |


2.2 Configure Networks


Open hardhat.config.js and add a network configuration.

You will need an RPC URL (e.g., from Alchemy or Infura) and your wallet's private key (stored securely in a .env file).

backend/.env (Securely store keys):

```
PRIVATE_KEY="YOUR_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY"
SEPOLIA_RPC_URL="YOUR_SEPOLIA_API_URL"
```

backend/hardhat.config.js (Snippet):

```
require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox");

require('dotenv').config();

module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.24",
  networks: {
    sepolia: {
      url: process.env.SEPOLIA_RPC_URL,
      accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY],
    },
  },
};
```

2.3 Deployment

Modify the scripts/deploy.js to deploy your specific contract, and then execute the deployment command.

| CLI Command | Directory | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia | backend/ | Deploys the contract to the Sepolia testnet. Outputs the Contract Address. |

> Key Output: The deployment script will log the Contract Address. Save this address!
>

3. 🌐 Frontend Integration
   
The frontend, located in my-evm-dapp/frontend/, needs the Contract ABI and Address to interact with the deployed contract.

3.1 Copy Artifacts (ABI)

The contract ABI is located in the artifacts/ folder created by Hardhat. You need to copy the JSON file containing the ABI to your frontend project.

# From the root directory: my-evm-dapp/

```
cp backend/artifacts/contracts/MyContract.sol/MyContract.json frontend/src/MyContract.json

```

3.2 Implement Web3 Interaction

In your frontend code (e.g., frontend/src/App.js), you use the Ethers.js library (installed in Step 1.2) to create a contract instance.

'''
// Example Frontend JS (e.g., App.js)
import abi from './MyContract.json'; // The copied ABI file

const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "0x...Your...Deployed...Address..."; // From Step 2.3

const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum);
const signer = provider.getSigner();

// Create the contract instance
const contract = new ethers.Contract(CONTRACT_ADDRESS, abi.abi, signer);

// Example of calling a contract function (transaction)
async function updateValue(newValue) {
  const tx = await contract.setValue(newValue);
  await tx.wait(); // Wait for transaction confirmation
}
```

3.3 Run and Build the Frontend

| CLI Command | Directory | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| npm start | frontend/ | Starts the local development server to test the DApp |
| npm run build | frontend/ | Creates the production-ready static assets (HTML/CSS/JS) |

4. 🌍 Final Deployment (Frontend)
The final step is to take the static assets generated by npm run build (usually in a build/ folder) and deploy them to a hosting service.

| CLI Command (Example: Netlify) | Directory | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| npm install -g netlify-cli | Global | Install the Netlify CLI |
| cd frontend | frontend/ | Navigate to the frontend directory |
| netlify deploy --prod --dir=build | frontend/ | Deploys the build/ folder content to Netlify's CDN |

Your DApp is now fully deployed:
 * Smart Contract: Deployed on the EVM-compatible chain (e.g., Sepolia).
   
 * Frontend UI: Deployed to a web server (e.g., Netlify/Vercel) and connected to the contract.
 * 
Would you like me to elaborate on setting up the private key securely using the dotenv package?
