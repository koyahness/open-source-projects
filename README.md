# Hi there, welcome to Koyah world of web3 in the EVM, SVM, Cosmos and BTC ecosystems.⌨️⌨️⌨️

<!--
**koyaness/koyaness** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on ...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with ...
- 💬 Ask me about ...
- 📫 How to reach me: ...
- 😄 Pronouns: ...
- ⚡ Fun fact: ...
-->
## 🤔 Looking for free software that any developer can contribute to the project?

#### There are several aspects you can help on:

- 👯 Improving documentation (see README.md and doc folder)
- 👯 Translations, the documentation into more languages
- 👯 Testing code, testing releases
- 👯 Participate on the mailing lists
- 👯 Improving UIs
- 👯 Coding (fix open issues or implement new features; especially those tagged as “good first issue” which are meant as introductory issues for external contributors)
- 👯 Reporting issues
- 👯 Responding to questions from other users

#### Starter Projects

Do you want to begin coding for Bitcoin Core and others etc but don’t have a specific improvement in mind? Here are a few ideas:

Fix existing issues: the issue tracker is the best place to find a useful way to contribute to projects. Before starting to write any patches for issues you find, you may want to comment on the issue to make sure nobody else is already working on it.

Write tests: Bitcoin Core for example is covered by many tests, but patches that improve test coverage are always welcome and are a great way to build familiarity with the codebase. See the documentation about automated testing etc.

#### 🔭 How to Report Issues

- Software version
- Source code (if applicable)
- Operating system
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Actual vs. expected behavior

#### 🔭 Workflow for Pull Requests

Fork off the develop branch and make your changes there.

Your commit messages should detail why you made your change in addition to what you did (unless it is a tiny change).

Additionally, if you are writing a new feature, please ensure you add appropriate test cases under test/

Make sure you respect the coding style for this project. Also, even though we do CI testing.

Please test your code and ensure that it builds locally before submitting a pull request.

Do a PR review checklist, example: https://github.com/argotorg/solidity/blob/develop/ReviewChecklist.md

### 💬 Solidity docs and websites

Solidity is a curly-bracket language designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
It is influenced by C++, Python, and JavaScript.

### 🔭 Ethereum chain code review

If you're looking for the Ethereum blockchain itself, there is no single repo.

Instead, Ethereum has multiple implementations of the protocol written in different programming languages for security and diversity.

This makes the network stronger and more diverse. The ideal goal is to achieve diversity without any client dominating to reduce any single points of failure.

The clients can be seen here: https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/#execution-clients
