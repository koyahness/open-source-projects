📜 Ethereum's Rollup-Centric Roadmap and Key Upgrades

This timeline details the past, current, and future milestones that define Ethereum's strategy to scale primarily through Layer-2 rollups.

⏳ Past Milestones (Foundation)

| Date | Upgrade/Event | Key Impact on Scaling |
|---|---|---|
| Oct 2020 | Vitalik Buterin publishes "A rollup-centric Ethereum roadmap" | Officially signaled the pivot in scaling strategy from sharding-first to rollup-first. |
| Dec 2020 | Beacon Chain Launch | Introduced the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism on a parallel chain. |
| Sep 2022 | The Merge | Ethereum transitions its consensus mechanism from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake (PoS). Energy usage dropped by \sim99.95\%. Set the fundamental security layer for rollups. |
| Apr 2023 | Shapella (Shanghai + Capella) | Enabled staked ETH withdrawals, significantly improving validator flexibility and capital efficiency. |
| Mar 2024 | Dencun Upgrade | Introduces EIP-4844 (Proto-Danksharding). This added new "blob" transactions for cheaper Layer-2 data posting, dramatically reducing L2 fees and congestion. |

🎯 Current Phase (2025: Scaling & User Experience)
| Date | Upgrade Name | Key Features & Rollup Impact |
|---|---|---|
| May 2025 | Pectra Upgrade | Account Abstraction (EIP-7702): Brings "smart wallet" features to all users, simplifying the user experience for interacting with rollups. Increased Blob Throughput: Raises the target for blobs (from 3 to 6, max 9), improving Layer-2 data capacity. |
| Dec 2025 | Fusaka Upgrade | PeerDAS (Peer Data Availability Sampling): Enables efficient and decentralized verification of rollup data. Blob-Only Forks: Allows for rapid, modular adjustments to scaling parameters. Scaling Potential: Prepares Ethereum's base layer to support rollups reaching >100,000 TPS combined. |

🔮 Future Milestones (Mass Adoption & Decentralization)
| Date | Phase/Upgrade | Key Objectives |
|---|---|---|
| 2026 | Glamsterdam Upgrade | Continues the path of the Surge/Verge/Purge roadmap. Focuses on more blob scaling (moving toward full Danksharding) and further decentralization of rollups (e.g., removing centralized sequencers). |
| 2027–2030 | Modular & Decentralized Ethereum | Full Danksharding: Complete data availability sampling and modular scaling. Rollup Decentralization: Implementation of permissionless sequencers, trustless bridges, and decentralized proof generation. |

Long-Term Goal

The long-term vision is a Modular Ethereum Stack, where:

 * Ethereum L1 serves as the security, data availability, and settlement layer.
 * Rollups (L2s) handle execution and vastly increase transaction throughput.
 * Target: >100,000 Transactions Per Second (TPS) across the L2 ecosystem.

🗺️ Roadmap Phases (Vitalik's Framework)

Vitalik Buterin's conceptual framework organizes the network's evolution into distinct, multi-year phases:
 * Merge: PoS transition (✅ Completed)
 * Surge: Rollup scaling, data sharding, and Proto-Danksharding (currently Ongoing)
 * Verge: Achieving Statelessness via Verkle Trees
 * Purge: History pruning and protocol simplification
 * Splurge: Miscellaneous User Experience (UX) and performance improvements
