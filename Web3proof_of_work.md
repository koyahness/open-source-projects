In the Web3 world, your wallet address is your identity, but your on-chain and off-chain activity is your reputation. Unlike a traditional CV where you "tell" people what you can do, Web3 allows you to "show" it through a verifiable trail of Proof of Work (PoW).
Here is a breakdown of how to build and categorize your Web3 résumé.
1. The Technical Layer: GitHub & Repositories
For developers, your code is your greatest advocate. It’s not just about the final product, but the consistency of your contributions.
 * Open Source Contributions: Forking popular protocols (like Uniswap or Aave) to build extensions or fixing bugs in EIPs (Ethereum Improvement Proposals).
 * Smart Contract Audits: Creating a repository where you document "practice" audits of known vulnerable contracts.
 * Hackathon Ships: Even if you didn't win, a completed project in a README.md file is a timestamped proof of your ability to build under pressure.
2. The Intellectual Layer: Mirror & X (Twitter)
Web3 moves at lightning speed. Showing that you can synthesize complex information is a high-value skill.
 * Mirror Articles: Use Mirror to publish long-form research. Since posts are minted as Writing NFTs, they serve as permanent, timestamped records of your insights on tokenomics or governance.
 * X Threads: Deconstruct complex DeFi strategies or explain new Layer 2 scaling solutions. High-quality threads often lead to direct DMs from founders and recruiters.
3. The Visual Layer: Design Mockups & Loom
If you are a designer or a product manager, "Proof of Work" means proving you understand the unique UX challenges of Web3 (like wallet onboarding or gas fee transparency).
 * Figma Protoypes: Share public links to UI/UX revamps of clunky dApps.
 * Loom Walkthroughs: Record a 2-minute video explaining the logic behind a feature you designed. It proves you aren't just making things look "pretty," but that you understand the underlying protocol.
How to Aggregate Your Trail
Don't let your work stay scattered. Use a "Web3 Portfolio Aggregator" to tie your identity together:
| Platform | Best For |
|---|---|
| Bento/Linktree | Centralizing social links and portfolios. |
| Layer3 / RabbitHole | Proving you have used specific protocols (On-chain credentials). |
| Peerlist / Talent Protocol | Building a professional profile specifically for the "builder" economy. |
| Lens Protocol | Creating a decentralized social graph that you own. |
Strategy Tip: The "Ship-to-Learn" Loop
The best PoW trails follow a simple loop:
 * Learn a new primitive (e.g., Account Abstraction).
 * Build a small tool or write a deep-dive thread about it.
 * Publish it publicly.
 * Repeat.
> Note: Consistency beats intensity. One GitHub commit or one insightful X thread per week is better than a massive burst of activity followed by months of silence.
